# CCCC-367
Materials for visualising the codicological structure of Parts II and V of Cambridge, Corpus Christi College, MS 367.

The following are collation diagrams of Parts II and V of Cambridge, Corpus Christi College MS 367, reflecting both the original order in which the
pages of the manuscript were first bound and the current order in which they are today.</p>

The diagrams models are found in the XML files which were created by Peter A. Stokes, based on descriptions of the manuscript by Neil Ker, Elaine Treharne and
Peter Stokes. 

The visualisations in the Output folders were generated using the Collation Modeller, directed by Dot Porter and Alberto Campagnolo. 

All images of manuscripts in the resulting outputs are imported directly from Parker on the Web 2.0 using  IIIF and are copyright of the Master and
Fellows of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International
